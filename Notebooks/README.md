**Data Building and Cleaning Notebook**
* This notebook focuses on the project's initial phase, where the skin cancer datasets are collected, combined, and cleaned.
* Covers data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values  and creating a structured dataset for model training.
* Provides insights into the dataset's composition, distribution, and the rationale behind data cleaning decisions.

**Preprocessing and Model Training Notebook**
* This notebook delves into the preprocessing and augmentation techniques to prepare the data for model training.
* Details the architecture and training of the skin cancer classification model, leveraging the DenseNet121 architecture.
* Includes discussions on optimization strategies, custom metrics, and model evaluation.
* Offers a comprehensive overview of the end-to-end process, from data preprocessing to training a robust skin cancer classification model.
